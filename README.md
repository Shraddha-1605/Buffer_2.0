1.Objective of the project :

The objective of Bank Management System project is to build optimal system for interaction between banking mechanism and user and to provide solutions to banking system.

2.Which data structure has been used in the project and why?

We have used Doubly Linked List . Linked List is one of the important data structures. Linked list is efficient for insertion and deletion these operations are fast and easy in linked list. In linked list memory is allocated during the run-time . So, we have used it in our project. As we are using c++ , we have done the operations using classes and object . We have made the data variables private which enhances the security of the system .

3.What did you learn while working on this project?
We have done this project using Doubly Linked List in C++. We learnt a lot more about linked list and a very important and essential concepts of C++. We have also learnt about how the bank actually works, what all functions bank can do. We learn some of important skills like teamwork, organization, planning and time management. We got experience of working with different people with different mindsets. So we have got one of the best experience while working on this project .

Features of the System :

In this project we have made all the operations that can make easy interaction with user and it manages the data of a user easily :

We have done the bank system operations under the project which is reliable to use for everyone .

a) We can create, modify, delete and search the account of a user . This operations can be done by customer panel .

e) It automatically generates account number and pin number of each account .
